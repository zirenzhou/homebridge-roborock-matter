// The switches shipped in 3.5.0 with one sentence about pairing buried in a
// paragraph of caveats, and the sentence was not even the whole truth. On
// Mathias' own server the plugin's child bridge carried `hap: { enabled:
// false }` — the Matter-only setup had switched the HomeKit half of that
// bridge off, quite reasonably, because until 3.5.0 the plugin published
// nothing over HAP. So three switches registered, the log said they were
// added, Homebridge was happy, and there was no QR code anywhere in the
// product that would have made them appear.
//
// That is the worst shape a feature can fail in: everything reports success
// and the user is left hunting. It cost the maintainer of this plugin an
// afternoon on his own house, which is the cheapest possible way to find out.
//
// The rule is enumerated over the surfaces rather than written once, because
// the failure was that only one surface mentioned pairing at all. Every place
// that offers the feature has to also say which QR code makes it work, and
// name the two codes that look right and are not.
