 * does can start an automation. A contact sensor is a trigger source in every
 * Home client, so mirroring the state onto one is the only way this works.
 *
 * The order is the order pponce ranked them in when asked which state he would
 * actually trigger on: docked first ("I'd use the docked feature on its own for
 * sure"), cleaning second. He also named the pair he wants them for — not
 * docked AND not cleaning means the robot is probably stuck somewhere — which
 * is why both ship together and why no third "stuck" sensor is guessed at: that
 * one is a timeout over these two, and it belongs in his automation where he
 * can pick the timeout, not in a plugin that would pick it for him.
