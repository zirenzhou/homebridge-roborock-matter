 * 10-second live-room observation cadence, which matters for the reason this
 * project already wrote down for backoff constants: a gate on the same order
 * as the cadence that produced the failure does not gate anything. The
 * previous rule — 2 readings, nominally 10 to 20 seconds — was exactly that
 * gate, which is why vp-debug12 still saw crossed rooms marked cleaned.
 *

   *
   * WHY THE TANK FAULT NEEDS THIS AT ALL. Apple Home does not draw
   * `operationalError` as a passive warning — it draws WaterTankEmpty as a
   * BLOCKING condition and says so in words. vp-debug12's screenshot in issue
   * #9: "Rellena el depósito de agua — 'Roborock Qrevo' empezará a limpiar
   * cuando se llene el depósito de agua." It is a push notification, not tile
   * decoration (Wazza151 confirmed the same on an a70 in #5), and it repeated
   * every 2 minutes while his robot was set to Vacuum. On a vacuum-only run
   * every word of it is false: the robot is not waiting for water and will not
   * start cleaning when the tank is filled. So this is not a preference about
   * when a warning is welcome — the plugin was asserting a block that did not
   * exist.
   *
   * WHERE THE 2-MINUTE REPEAT CAME FROM. It was us, and for three releases
   * this comment said it could not be. The old text is worth keeping as a
   * warning about the measurement, not just the conclusion: it read "measured
   * against matter.js 0.18.0-alpha, the build Homebridge ships … no timer in
   * this plugin can produce a 68 -> 0 -> 68 cycle". The measurement was
   * sound. The premise was not — Homebridge 2.4.0 ships @matter/main 0.17.9,
   * not 0.18.0-alpha, and 0.17.9 CLEARS `operationalError` on every write of
   * `operationalState`, including a write of the value already stored. The
   * 60-second heartbeat re-writes the whole cluster, so the plugin was
   * clearing the fault and re-raising it once a minute, and matter.js emits
   * the cluster's `OperationalError` event on the 0 -> 68 edge: one
   * notification per two heartbeats. Two minutes.
   *
   * Fixed in 3.30.0 by writing the two attributes apart and never re-writing
   * an unchanged `operationalState`; the measurement table is in
   * writeOperationalStateCluster(). What remains true below is the part about
   * the tank reading and the authority flapping — those are the robot's own
   * data moving, and they are still the two ways a genuine repeat can happen.
   *
   * BUT THERE ARE EXACTLY TWO WAYS IT CAN STILL FLAP, and the second one is
   * easy to miss because it is not in isWaterTankEmpty() at all. First, the
   * tank reading itself flipping. Second — and this is the one vp-debug12
   * described in #9 as "changes to ready momentarily and then activates the
   * water error" — the AUTHORITY below switching. Which branch decides depends
   * on the robot's live state, so a robot dipping in and out of a run state
   * hands the decision back and forth between its own report and the user's
   * selection, and when those two disagree the fault tracks the oscillation.
   * Neither path is timed; both are the robot's own data moving.
   *
   * The log settles which, if any, is happening, but read it knowing that the
   * "Matter publish for …" line is de-duplicated against the previous rendered
   * line (lastLoggedMatterPublishLine): a steady fault appears ONCE and then
   * the log goes quiet, so repeated identical lines are not what a stuck fault
   * looks like. A flap looks like the `, fault=68 …` segment appearing and
   * disappearing between lines — a cleared fault renders as no fault segment
   * rather than as `fault=0`.
   *
   * AND DO NOT GATE THIS ON "A RUN WAS REQUESTED" EITHER, however tempting —
   * in a mopping mode the sentence is still not quite true for a parked robot.
   * Wazza151's confirmed case in #5 is a docked, idle robot with an empty
   * tank, which is precisely the case such a gate would silence. Warning about
   * an empty tank while the robot is parked is the point of the warning.
   *
   * WHY "VACUUM IS SELECTED" IS NOT THE TEST. `selectedCleanMode` is not
   * persisted: it starts at CLEAN_MODE_VACUUM on every restart (measured 20
   * Aug), so reading it directly would silence the tank warning on every robot
   * until somebody happened to touch the mode picker — quietly undoing the one
   * field-verified thing this attribute does. Only a mode somebody actually
   * said counts: the robot's own report while it is genuinely cleaning, the
   * user's selection outside that. The wind-down is excluded for the same
   * reason getCurrentCleanMode() excludes it — a dock washing a mop runs water
   * with the fan off and on again, which reads as vacuum+mop and is nothing of
   * the sort.
   *
   * WHERE THIS DELIBERATELY DIFFERS FROM getCurrentCleanMode(), because the
   * difference looks like an oversight and is not: there, an acknowledged
   * Matter selection stays visible while the robot's status catches up. Here
   * the applied-type pin below is the authority during that same window, so a
   * stale water report cannot invent a tank warning for water the robot has
   * already acknowledged turning off.
   *
   * The derived type goes through acceptLiveCleanType() like every other
   * consumer of it, and that gate is right here for the same reason it is
   * right there: a robot whose water this plugin has already turned off and
   * had acknowledged is not using water, however long its own report takes to
   * agree. Announcing a block during that window would be the lag talking.
   *
   * The HAP `Water Tank Empty` sensor is deliberately NOT gated by this. It
   * states a fact about the tank, makes no claim about what the robot is going
   * to do, and automations are built on it.

   * (operationalState 1), 2104 on the way back to the dock
   * (operationalState 64). Nothing was wrong with any of the 3 robots at any

   *
   * Establishing that took hand-correlating each code against the neighbouring

   * while the robot is demonstrably cleaning normally invites a false report.

   * The dedupe key stays the code alone rather than code-and-state. Keying on
   * both would name a lingering code once per transition it survives, which is

   * Log the publish evidence line whenever it would read differently from the

   *
   * The line's stated purpose is to make an Apple Home display problem
   * diagnosable from a single log excerpt. It was emitted only when the
   * BATTERY value changed, which defeated that: a user in issue #8 sent a log
   * spanning a whole cleaning run in which every operational-state transition
   * was invisible, because the line only appeared on the four polls where the
   * battery happened to tick down. Comparing rendered lines — rather than a
   * hand-written list of interesting fields — means any value the line names
   * triggers it, including one added to the message later. A heartbeat's
   * forced republish of unchanged values still says nothing new, so the
   * self-healing full write stays silent at INFO.
   *
   * It is not silent at debug, and that gap cost issue #7 a round trip. A
   * docked robot at 100 % renders an identical line every time, so its publish
   * evidence appeared once at startup and never again — and the reporter was
   * asked to check whether these lines were still being written while his Apple
   * Home tile was dead. He looked, correctly found none in eleven minutes, and
   * the answer meant nothing: absence was what this method does, not evidence
   * that the plugin had stopped. "Is this plugin still publishing?" was
   * unanswerable from the log at any level. One debug line per suppressed
   * publish makes it answerable without spending a single INFO line, which is
   * the whole point of the deduplication above.

  /**
   * Write the RvcOperationalState cluster, one attribute group at a time.
   *
   * THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR, MEASURED. In @matter/main 0.17.9 — the build
   * Homebridge 2.4.0 actually ships — writing `operationalState` CLEARS
   * `operationalError` to `{ errorStateId: 0 }`. Every time, including a
   * write of the value the store already holds. Measured on 17 Sep 2026
   * against 0.17.9, one attribute at a time, with a standing
   * `operationalError: 68` (Clean water tank empty):
   *
   *   operationalState, same value (0x42) ....... 68 -> 0   WIPED
   *   operationalState, different value (0x41) .. 68 -> 0   WIPED
   *   currentPhase, same value .................. 68 -> 68  kept
   *   currentPhase, different value ............. 68 -> 68  kept
   *   phaseList ................................. 68 -> 68  kept
   *   operationalStateList ...................... 68 -> 68  kept
   *
   * So the plugin's own 60-second heartbeat, which re-writes the whole
   * cluster with force=true, was clearing the tank fault and re-raising it
   * once a minute — and matter.js emits the cluster's `OperationalError`
   * EVENT on the 0 -> 68 edge. Six heartbeats produced six attribute changes
   * and three events: one roughly every two minutes.
   *
   * That is the notification vp-debug12 reported in #9 ("Rellena el depósito
   * de agua…", repeating every 2 minutes), Wazza151 in #5, and
   * n0rt0nthec4t in #26 ("repeated notifications in Home App"). Apple was not
   * re-raising a standing block, as the comment on isWaterTankEmpty() said
   * for three releases: the plugin was genuinely re-raising it, through a
   * matter.js behaviour nobody had measured on the version people run. The
   * earlier measurement that said otherwise was taken against 0.18.0-alpha,
   * which does not behave this way.
   *
   * THE RULE, and why force does not apply to this one cluster:
   *
   * 1. `operationalState` is written only when it differs from the last value
   *    written. A forced re-write cannot help here and can only wipe the
   *    fault, so force is deliberately ignored for this attribute.
   * 2. Everything else in the cluster is written normally — none of it
   *    touches the error.
   * 3. `operationalError` is written LAST, in its own transaction, and only
   *    when it differs from what is believed published. Writing
   *    `operationalState` invalidates that belief, because the store just
   *    cleared it, so the error is re-asserted right after a state change.
   *
   * Measured again with this rule in place: 20 heartbeats with a standing
   * tank fault produce 0 attribute changes and 0 events; a genuine state
   * change keeps the fault (2 attribute changes, 1 event, unavoidable —
   * the store really was cleared); clearing and re-raising the tank still
   * produce exactly one event each.

   * The Matter run mode to publish.
   *
   * Apple Home treats RvcRunMode as the answer to "is this robot cleaning?":
   * it announces a cleaning that started when the mode goes to Cleaning and
   * one that finished when it goes back to Idle. A dock chore is neither.
   * Emptying the dust bin while the robot sat idle in its dock published
   * Cleaning and then Idle again, so the dock's own housekeeping announced a
   * cleaning that never happened (issue #9, Q Revo). The mirror image matters
   * just as much: a robot that empties its bin in the MIDDLE of a run must not
   * announce that the run finished and started again.
   *
   * So a dock chore inherits the run mode that was published before it began,
   * instead of deciding one of its own. Transit does the same, and for the same
   * reason: after the dock empties the bin the robot reports "returning to
   * dock" for about a second before it charges again, and publishing Cleaning
   * for that blip announced a second cleaning that started and finished from a
   * robot that never moved (issue #9, the reporter's follow-up). Driving home
   * is how a real run ENDS, never how one begins.
   *
   * Both are recognised from the robot's own state, not from the
   * controller-facing one: with "Extended Operational States" off, emptying
   * the dust bin is rewritten to RUNNING one level below and seeking the
   * charger to STOPPED, so reading that would leave the rule working only for
   * the users who enabled the toggle — which is exactly how the transit blip
   * survived 3.6.2 and reached the field. The toggle decides how a state is
   * displayed; it never decides whether a cleaning happened.

    // for a benefit that has never once materialised. That is also why
    // 1.4.61 removed the plugin's original write. Do NOT explain this by
    // "bridged accessory": every robot here gets its own Matter node, which
    // is why each is scanned separately, so a bridge is never involved. #9
    // has the same attribute rendering correctly elsewhere; the condition
    // that separates the two cases is still unknown, and guessing at it has
    // cost this plugin two round trips already.

    // It has its own config key rather than riding on fault reporting, so it
    // can be switched off again without losing the Error state feature — the
    // mistake 3.3.0 made by bundling the two. The key is not on the settings
    // page: 3.12.0 removed that whole section because a page of switches
    // whose off position can brick an accessory is worse than no page.

    // The operational state is deliberately NOT forced to Error along with
    // it. Wazza151's third test did exactly that and Apple still drew

    // refused a Start command, which is a real cost for a robot that is

   * A full-home clean operates on every supported area, and we cannot know
   * which room the robot is physically inside — the robots do not report it.
   * So `currentArea` stays null: no room is named that we are not sure of.
   *
   * The scope is published as OPERATING rather than PENDING, and that choice
   * is the whole point of this function, so it is worth writing down why.
   *
   * Matter has 4 progress values and none of them means "in this run, exact
   * position unknown". Both available encodings are therefore imperfect:
   * every area operating asserts the robot is in all of them, every area
   * pending asserts it is in none of them. The second is the one that reads
   * as a bug, because Apple Home renders "nothing is operating" as *the robot
   * is still on its way* — "Traveling to Room", "heading to the room",
   * "Desplazándose" — and keeps saying it for the entire run while the robot
   * is demonstrably cleaning.
   *
   * 2.3.1 already tried the honest-looking option. It moved a full clean from
   * an empty list to an all-pending list hoping Apple's label would improve,
   * and said out loud that whether it did was up to Apple's renderer. It did
   * not: skmzwanke reported the stuck label in #8, and vp-debug12 reported
   * exactly the same thing in #9 months and many versions later, in Spanish.
   * 2 independent users, one unchanged symptom, one failed mitigation.
   *
   * So this picks the encoding that produces the true statement at the only
   * place a person looks. The robot IS operating; it is not on its way. Live
   * map-position tracking still collapses this to the accurate single-room
   * picture the moment it resolves a room, and the run still flips wholly to
   * completed when the robot returns to the charger.

  /**
   * Whether the robot is in its dock.
   *
   * charge_status is a TIEBREAKER for a state that does not answer the
   * question, never an override of one that does. It used to be an independent
   * sufficient condition (`|| !!chargeStatus`), which contradicted the rule
   * this file already applies one function below: getRoborockOperationalState()
   * consults charge_status only in its `default:` arm — a robot reporting
   * state 5 is RUNNING no matter what charge_status says.
   *
   * The two fields are not read at the same instant. A sparse live frame
   * carrying only dps 121 moves `state` while `charge_status` keeps whatever it
   * held before the robot left its dock, and getNumberStatus() falls back to
   * the slower HomeData snapshot for any field the live frame omits. So the
   * pair "state = Room Clean, charge_status = 1" is not a contradiction in the
   * robot; it is one fresh field beside one stale one, and letting the stale
   * one win made the plugin call a robot mid-run docked.
   *
   * Measured in issue #8 on a Saros 10, twice out of two attempts on different
   * versions: the plugin published operationalState=1 for eight minutes with a
   * falling battery and live room tracking moving between rooms, and still
   * logged "despite a docked snapshot" when the run was ended from Apple Home.
   * The log line was the visible half. The costly half was shouldRetryReturnToDock(),
   * which asks this first and gave up before it reached
   * isRoborockActivelyCleaningAwayFromDock() — so the dock-retry never armed for
   * exactly the robots whose charge_status lags.
   *
   * Reuses that predicate rather than listing the states again: a second
   * hand-written copy of a list is the most repeated defect in this codebase.
