/**
 * Stop asking a robot a question it has stopped answering.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, IN NUMBERS FROM REAL INSTALLATIONS.
 *
 * A Roborock request that gets no reply costs a full 10-second pending
 * request, and nothing in this plugin used to notice that the same request
 * had failed the same way a hundred times before. Measured:
 *
 * - `Stueetage` (`a70`) on my own server: `get_map_v1` had failed **95 times
 *   in a row** when I looked on 17 Sep 2026, and 225 in a row twelve days
 *   earlier. The robot has never answered that request; it was asked every
 *   ten seconds of every clean regardless.
 * - Issue #9 (`a75`): 40 in a row, while the same robot answered everything
 *   else — the log line is the only thing the user ever sees of it.
 * - Issues #22 (`a144`) and #24 (`a51`): 647 suppressed timeout warnings
 *   across `get_status`, `get_room_mapping`, `get_multi_maps_list`,
 *   `get_consumable`, `get_carpet_mode`, `get_carpet_clean_mode` and
 *   `get_water_box_custom_mode` in a single session.
 *
 * So this is a register, not a constant per finding: one place that counts
 * consecutive no-answers per robot per method, stops asking for a while once
 * the count is conclusive, and starts again by itself.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.
 *
 * - **It never trips on a refusal.** A robot that answers "I do not support
 *   that" has answered; `isPollCommandUnsupported` already handles those, and
 *   conflating the two would hide a real reply behind a silence.
 * - **It never trips on a transport error.** `EAI_AGAIN`, a dropped MQTT
 *   link or "not connected" is the network's problem, not the robot's, and it
 *   comes back on its own. Only a request that was sent and drew no answer at
 *   all counts.
 * - **It is not wired to `get_status` or to commands.** The tile lives on
 *   `get_status`, and a command the user just pressed must always be sent.
 *   Only the optional polls and the live-room map fetch go through it.
 *
 * It is also deliberately forgiving: one answer resets the count completely,
 * and an open breaker retries by itself after the cooldown, so a robot that
 * was merely busy for a few minutes loses nothing.

  // and friends — words the timeout message never contains. 3.31.0 replaced
  // that with a regex for `MQTT connection state: false`, which cannot occur
  // either: messageQueueHandler rejects a down link EARLIER, with a refusal
  // that has no "timed out after" in it at all, so the timeout arm is only
  // ever reached with the flag reading `true`. Both gates were dead code, and
  // both had a green test built from a hand-written string the code cannot
  // produce.
  //
  // So the timeout now carries what it knows as data. `transportWasUp` is
  // read at REJECTION time, not at send time — a link that died mid-flight is
  // the whole case the exclusion exists for.

  //
  //   `… timed out after 10 seconds. MQTT connection state: ${mqttConnectionState}`
  //   `… timed out after 10 seconds Local connect state: ${localConnectionState}`
  //
  // so a link that was down while the request was pending reads
  // "MQTT connection state: false" — which matches none of the names above.
  // The whole exclusion had nothing left to exclude, and a four-minute
  // network blip could therefore trip the breaker and suppress a perfectly
  // healthy method for six hours, under a log line claiming this was "not a
  // connection failure". Read the boolean instead.
