  /**
   * Every timer in this library goes through here, which is why 2 rules live
   * in these 4 lines rather than at each of the ~20 call sites.
   *
   * **Unref.** `src/timers.ts` states the policy — "a pending timer must
   * never be why Homebridge cannot shut down" — and `src/` honours it at all
   * of its own call sites. This library never imported that module (JS/TS
   * boundary), so every timer it created was ref'd, including each in-flight
   * request timeout of up to 30 seconds. Homebridge always has listening
   * sockets of its own holding the event loop, so unref'ing here cannot make
   * the process exit early; it only stops these timers being the last thing
   * standing during a shutdown.
   *
   * **Catch.** Several callers pass an `async` function, and the returned
   * promise was dropped on the floor. Homebridge installs an
   * `uncaughtException` handler whose body is `process.kill(SIGTERM)`, and
   * node routes unhandled rejections through it, so one rejection from a
   * poll loop takes the whole bridge down. No caller can reject today —
   * every one of them catches internally — but `updateDataMinimumData` has
   * no `try` in its 114 lines and survives only because each of its callees
   * happens to catch. That is a contract nobody wrote down. This makes it
   * one that cannot be broken from the outside.

    // skmzwanke selected Vacuum in Apple Home, the fan command timed out after
    // two seconds, the water command was never sent, and his Saros 10 ran a
    // vacuum-and-mop over the room he had asked to be vacuumed (#8). A
    // cosmetic command that did not answer in time cancelled the one that
    // carried the user's actual choice.
    //
    // Dropping the early return cannot run the start command late: the caller
    // races this whole sequence against its own prep timeout, which is what
    // bounds the delay. The early return was buying latency protection that
    // was already paid for one level up.
    //
    // Ordering alone was not enough, though, and skmzwanke's 3.4.8 log shows
    // why: up to three commands are sent one after another, each with a
    // two-second timeout, inside a window of 2500 ms. The water command was
    // started but not finished when the window closed, so the start command
    // still overtook the command carrying his "vacuum only" choice and the
    // robot mopped. Sizing each command against what is LEFT of the window is
    // what makes the order matter — the mode-carrying command now gets the
    // window, and a cosmetic one that no longer fits is reported, not started.
    // Vacuum-then-mop is a property of the run, set with one command that
    // also carries the suction, water and route — the command the Roborock
    // app itself sends. It goes first because it carries the user's choice;
    // when the robot takes it, the separate water and suction commands below
    // would only repeat it, and are skipped.

      // one method that changes anything, and it destroys a schedule rather
      // than toggling one — so there is no write here to put behind a HomeKit
      // switch, and a destructive verb aimed at a stranger's live account to
      // see what happens is not a measurement this project will take.
      //
      // That rules out the resource, not the feature. Our own `executeScene`
      // reaches `user/scene/{id}/execute`, so sub-resources under a scene id
      // demonstrably exist and carry verbs the scene itself does not. Whether
      // one of them is the toggle is the last question this instrument can
      // ask, and it is asked WITH CONTROLS, because on its own an `Allow`
      // header proves nothing:
      //
      //   - `user/scene` — the collection, where a REST API most often keeps
      //     an update;
      //   - `user/scene/{id}/enable` — the literal candidate for the nested
      //     flag the reporter's app flips;
      //   - `user/scene/device/{duid}` — the POSITIVE control. This run has
      //     ALREADY read it successfully, so it is mapped beyond doubt. If
      //     OPTIONS cannot describe even that, the instrument does not see
      //     routes and every other answer in this set is noise. It is also
      //     why the control is this route and not `/execute`: a control must
      //     not be a path whose real verb runs a robot.
      //   - a path that cannot exist — the NEGATIVE control. If THAT comes
      //     back with an Allow header, the server answers everything and no
      //     positive here means anything.
      //
      // Together they bound the search rather than extend it: this round
      // either names a route or shows that no later round would.
      //
      // Asking costs nothing that could alter a schedule, and that is

   * back, its LAN socket reconnects first, the next local poll succeeds, the
   * stale snapshot still says offline, both intervals die. From then on the
